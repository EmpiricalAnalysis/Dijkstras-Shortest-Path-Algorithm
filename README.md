# Dijkstra's Shortest-Path Algorithm

This is a project I completed while taking "Stanfordx: Algorithms Design And Analysis, Part I" on Coursera. The purpose of this project is to allow students to practice coding up Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm. Students then apply their algorithms to an undirected weighted graph and compute the shortest-path distances between vertex 1 and every other vertex of the graph.

The java codes I wrote are in the src folder.
